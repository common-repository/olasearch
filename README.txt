Quickly find articles and events in a chat window by using Ola Search's Searchbot!

== Description ==

Conversations are what makes life interesting, and when using the Ola Searchbot on your site, your visitors can ask questions in natural language related to the site’s content and our bot can give you accurate results. For example, if you are looking for an article that was published last week by a particular author on a certain topic, you can ask:

> articles on spacex by jackie wattles published last week

Don’t worry if you can’t remember the author’s name, our smart suggestions will help you craft your question as you type!

Or perhaps you’re looking for some events near you. No problem, try:

> events near me

Looking for the latest events a city you’re visiting next month?

> what events are happening in London in May?

Our Searchbot uses the powerful Ola platform which incorporates machine-learning algorithms and a natural language conversational engine for all its search, providing a thoroughly unique experience for your visitors.

Here are some more examples you can try asking:

- latest articles
- latest events
- what's happening in australia?
- tennis events in singapore
- are there any formula one events happening in brazil next month?

Our Searchbot plugin is easy to install, give it a try!

If you are hosting events using [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) by Modern Tribe Inc, you’ll be pleased to know that our Searchbot works seamlessly with this plugin and users can ask questions relating to venue as well. For example: "what events are happening at Rogers Arena?"
